## Manifesto — Key Principles (English Summary)

> "AI is our ally, not our substitute."

**Ownership & Review**
- Anyone opening a Pull Request is responsible and must fully understand all code and choices.
- AI supports development but does not decide for us.
- Code reviewers are accountable for quality. Technical competence remains essential.

**Documentation & Transparency**
- The `Agents.md` document is the foundation and must be updated with unique project needs, rules, and repeated chat requests.

**Task Focus**
- Work strictly within the boundaries of the assigned task or bug. Suggestions outside scope should be reported or turned into new user stories.

**Clear, Reproducible Tasks**
- Break down work into atomic, manageable tasks, especially in experimental phases.
- All requirements and bugs must be clearly documented with steps to reproduce.

**Prompting & Standardization**
- Prompts and model choices are team assets—not personal or improvised artifacts. 
- Effective prompts and model decisions should be shared, discussed, improved, and documented to create team standards and best practices.

**Collaboration & Sharing**
- Team discussion and knowledge sharing are essential. AI is an ally, but human competence and ongoing collaboration provide true value.

**Our Mission**

> "To experiment with AI in a responsible, transparent, and collaborative way—maintaining human control over decisions and ensuring quality, security, and alignment with team standards."
